# mesoscale_SSTgrad
This repository stores matlab scripts that are used to detect and compute the SST gradient at mesoscale. 

SST data includes: 
 - RHB along track data [x]
 - SWITFs drifters (to be added)
 - Wave Gliders (to be added)
 - P3 radiometer (to be added)

To-DO:
 - document the algorithm for front detection.
